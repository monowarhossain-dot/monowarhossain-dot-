I am currently shifting my career toward Data Science to strengthen my analytical, technical, and research abilities.
I am actively building real-world dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, expanding my analytics portfolio, and improving my skills in key data technologies.
My objective is to develop strong capabilities in data analysis, data modeling, SQL, and Python to support both professional growth and future academic research.
