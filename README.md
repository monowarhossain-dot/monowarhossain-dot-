# Hi, I am Md. Monowar Hossain 👋
### Service System Designer & Data-Driven Researcher (Public Systems)

I am a Service System Designer who believes that **data is the most powerful tool for human-centered design.** With a solid foundation in quantitative research and marketing, I focus on identifying systemic friction in public sectors (Healthcare & Banking) and redesigning them for trust and accessibility.

Instead of just analyzing data for business metrics, I translate raw user data into actionable **Service Blueprints** and ethical digital loops.

### 🔭 What I am currently working on:
- **Architecting Trust:** Developing the **'Shomoti' Passport model**, a visible consent design framework for digital health systems in Bangladesh.
- **Data-Driven Design:** Leveraging quantitative tools (PLS-SEM, Python) to uncover hidden user behaviors, specifically focusing on Gen Z demographics and digital transparency.
- **Building Dashboards:** Creating real-world interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) to visualize systemic bottlenecks and service lags.

### 🌱 My Core Objectives:
- To bridge the gap between complex statistical research and intuitive service blueprinting.
- To pursue a Master’s degree in Service Design and Innovation, exploring the integration of high-tech digital governance with human dignity (inspired by the Nordic/Baltic welfare models).
- To build open-source data projects that support ethical public policy and better decision-making.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodologies:
- **Service Design:** Service Blueprinting | User Journey Mapping | Ethnographic Research | Figma 
- **Data & Analytics:** Python | SQL | Power BI | Tableau | Advanced Excel
- **Statistical Modeling:** PLS-SEM (SmartPLS) | Quantitative Analysis
